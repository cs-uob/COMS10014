## Mock Exam

  Below is a mock exam which mimics the style and format of the December exam. All questions are multiple choice, where each question has exactly 1 correct answer. If you wish to try this in exam style conditions, note that calculators are **NOT** permitted and that you are permitted to use one double sided A4 sheet of notes (printed or handwritten).
