## Textbooks

We do not closely follow any one textbook, and you are not required to buy any textbooks for this unit: this is not a "one chapter of the book per lecture" kind of unit. Instead, your main resources will be the lectures and lecture notes, along with the worksheets and solutions.

That said, for students who do like to learn from books, the following ones may be worth checking:

  - _Kenneth Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and its Applications._ This is the standard textbook for first-year university mathematics in many CS departments; the library has some paper copies (all editions work equally well for our purposes). I would not advise buying your own copy unless you really like the book, and if you do, second-hand copies may be available.
  - _Clive Newstead, [An Infinite Descent into Pure Mathematics](https://infinitedescent.xyz/)._ This is a textbook on logic, available as a free PDF download in the link above. It might be particularly helpful during the first weeks for those who want a fully written out treatment of some of the detailed parts of logic and proof.
  - _Lehman, Leighton and Meyer, [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring18/mcs.pdf)._ It is only lightly related to the specific selection of topics we cover in this unit, but it is written by people working at MIT and google who clearly know their maths, and it does cover both some "how to write proofs" and some probability theory.

## Week 6

Week 6 is reading week. There are no lectures, workshops or drop-ins.

# Part 2 - Probability Theory

_For the second half of the unit, I'm trying something slightly new in the lecture notes. When presenting mathematics, there's always a question how much "back story" to include - the history of the topics, the people who discovered them, the questions they were trying to answer in the first place, philosophical and sometimes even theological points that were relevant to the discoveries in question. Alongside this, there's the question of how much intuition and motivation to present, separately from the definitions and formulas and calculations._

_My experiment for this half of the course is to have the first page of each set of written lecture notes be solely about back story and motivation, narrated by Celian the Elf (pronounced Kelian). I'm sure for some of you, this will help you understand the topic better or make it more interesting; for others, you might not like the style - that's ok, you can just skip the first page of the written notes and the "mathsy" part starts on Page 2._

Small change of plan:

  - No worksheet (this would have been class test 3, but that is cancelled).
  - Everyone who has attended at least one workshop so far gets +1 attendance for this workshop for free, so attending is not mandatory.
  - Instead, the Tuesday 2-4 hour becomes a drop-in session.

  - We will continue with continuous distributions if necessary; if not then we will skip the lecture. The workshop will take place as usual.

## Week 12

Week 12 is revision week.

  - No lectures this week.
  - The two 2-hour workshops become drop-ins.
  - No attendance will be taken, and Week 12 cannot be used to make up missed attendance earlier in the term. The drop-ins are optional to attend.
  - The Tuesday 5-6pm drop-in is cancelled as we already have 4h of drop-ins this week.
