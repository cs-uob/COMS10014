# COMS10014 Mathematics A

Welcome to the unit website for COMS10014 Mathematics for Computer Science A in the 2024-25 academic year!

_Students looking for previous years' versions should select the appropriate tag in the github repository, or access the files for their year directly through Microsoft Teams._

This unit and its companion Mathematics B teach you the basic mathematics that you will need in your Computer Science degree. The topics have been selected based on the needs of units in later years linked to some of our research areas, for example algorithms, machine learning, data science or computational neuroscience as well as topics in statistics that will be of interest to you when you perform experiments or evaluations in your final project or other units later on in your degree.

All materials that you will need for the unit will be linked to from this page; some links will require you to authenticate with the university's Microsoft Single Sign-On.
