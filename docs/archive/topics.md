# Topics on Mathematics A

This unit is based around three topic areas:

  * Logic and Proof 
  * Sets, Functions, and Relations
  * Probability

Logic and proof is in some sense the mathematics of how computers work - both at the hardware level and at the software level.
This mode of thinking is essential to reasoning about programs, and can be used to prove that a program does what it should or to design a program correctly in the first place.

Set, functions, and relation give us the basic mathematical building blocks of many data structures.
In this part of the course, you will also look at combinatorics, i.e. the mathematic of counting, which serves as a key foundation for much of algorithms and probability.

Finally, we will look at probability - the way in which we model an unpredictable, chaotic world of which we have complete and accurate knowledge. The material you learn here is also a foundation for machine learning.
