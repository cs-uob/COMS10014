# Schedule

The timetable sessions for this unit are arranged into 2 x 1 hour lectures and 2 x 2 hour problem classes a week at the following times/locations:

 - Lecture: Monday 12:00-13:00, Queens 1.40 (Pugsley)
 - Problem Class: Tuesday 13:00-15:00 Queens F.101 (Bill Brown Suite)
 - Lecture: Wednesday 09:00-10:00 Queens 1.40 (Pugsley)
 - Problem Class: Thursday 13:00-15:00 Queens F.101 (Bill Brown Suite)

## Lecture and Notes

Typically, each lecture will introduce a new topic for which there are accompanying notes to read in your own time, see [materials](materials.md).
<!-- Each topic will be associated with a lecture and accompanying notes to read in your own time. -->
It is your own choice if you read the notes before or after the lecture, but you are expected to _both_ attend the lecture and read the notes for each session
Sometimes, the notes will elaborate on something we do not mention in the lecture.

Lectures will typically be delivered on boards, writing with pen or chalk depending on the room set-up.
Our lecture recording systems are not set up to record this kind of lecture properly - the cameras in some rooms do not have the correct resolution to capture all boards, for example - so you should assume that for practical purposes, there are no usable lecture recordings. This is allowed in our university, and on this unit, you will have lecture notes available too. But, you should take your own notes in the lectures where possible, and of course catch up in your own time on any lectures you missed for a good reason.

<!-- ## Comprehension Questions

After each lecture and notes, there will be a sheet of short comprehension questions that you should answer in your own time. You will get the solutions to these questions at the same time as the question sheets.

The idea of these questions is that if you have understood the material in the lecture, then answering the comprehension questions will be both quick and easy. If anything is not clear to you about these questions, you should ask a teaching assistant in the following workshop.

You should do the comprehension questions for each session after attending the lecture and reading the notes, but before attending the workshop. -->

## Problem Classes

For each lecture there is an associated problem class giving you the opportunity to put what you have learnt into practice - this will be where your main learning happens for the unit.
During these two hour workshops, you will work in independently or in groups to solve the worksheet associated with the preceding lecture.
There will be 20 workshops in total, two each in weeks 1-5 and two each in weeks 7-11 

We do not require you to submit your solutions to the problem classes; however, solutions will be made available a few days after the workshop for you to look at in your own time.

There is also an **attendance hurdle** associated with these workshops, see [attendance](attendance.md) for details.

<!-- At the start of each workshop, I will usually have some announcements or updates. After this, if you have any questions about the lecture material or the comprehension questions, you will have an opportunity to sit down with a teaching assistant, and usually an area of the room will be indicated for students with questions. Afterwards, you can work on the worksheets. If you have no questions at the start of a worksheet, you can sit down at a table with other students and start, as a group, working on the worksheet directly. The teaching assistants will spend the rest of the workshop helping groups with the worksheets.

<!-- ## Class Tests

Three workshops will be class tests - exact dates will be announced with enough time to prepare for each one. Class tests do not count towards your grade for the unit, but attending them (even if you do badly on the test) counts for the attendance hurdle just like other workshops.

For the class tests, in the first hour you solve some questions under semi-exam conditions (e.g. individually, no talking). In the second hour we will go through the solutions together.

The class tests are opportunities for all of the following:
  - practicing and assessing your own mathematical knowledge
  - practicing the format of the exam (class tests use the same style of answer sheets)
  - experiencing the kind of questions that could come up in an exam. -->

## Individual Study

Outside the contact hours, you are expected to study and revise in your own time. 
On average, you should reckon with 4 hours of individual study time per session. This includes reading the lecture notes, going over your own notes from the lecture, finishing any questions on the worksheets that you did not get through in the workshop, checking your solutions against the sample solutions when they come out, looking up anything you do not understand yet in textbooks or online, and revising material with your favourite system, for upcoming class tests and the exam.

Studying at university may be _drastically_ different from what you are used to. We expect a certain degree of independent learning.
The task is no longer to memorise the solution for exam questions - instead you must integrate your knowledge and skill through practice.
This means you may well be challenged to apply ideas in contexts that are unfamiliar, where not all the information is given to you.
We encourage you to post questions you have on the unit teams; however, you should try to exhaust your own capacity to solve it first.
